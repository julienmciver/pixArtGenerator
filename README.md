# pixArtGenerator
Desktop pixel art/mosaic project art generator.

To run the main desktop component, run "pixmain.py"

Main screen, choose grid dimensions:

Click "Upload Image" to open a file selector. The image I am uploading and the generated image are below:

You might notice that the generated image is pixelated and the colors are slightly different. This is because the image was generated using only colors extracted from pictures of beads I bought from a bead shop. To extract colors, save the images of the materials you want to make a mosaic out of (in this case, beads), and run "palletteFinder.py". 

So if this image were to be created from those beads, this is what it would look like.

After saving the image as a mosaicProj, and specifying the medium for the mosaic (in this case, beads), the relevant files will be stored in the mobile app component of the pixel art generator (link to the kivy app here: )

A desktop demonstration of how this app would work is here:

After following the instructions of the mosaeek app, I used 19000 beads to create the image below. It is unfinished, but it illustrates nicely the end goal of the mosaeek app, and the pixart generator's role in it:
